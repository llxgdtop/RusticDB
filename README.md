# RusticDB
A from-scratch, educational SQL database implementation written in Rust.
Implements core SQL features (parsing, execution, storage) for learning purposes.
Not production-ready, but a fully-functional tour of database internals.

If you like, please give me a star.

Currently, the storage engine is based on memory, and it is only natural to switch to a disk-based storage engine. During development, I implemented a simplified version of the Bitcask storage engine but did not commit it. Readers can consider implementing the Engine trait themselves to enable this SQL database to store data on disk. For beginners, they can implement Bitcask or BTree; for more advanced users, they can implement BPlusTree or LSM-Tree.
